> Updated project based on **[Ania Kubów](https://github.com/kubowania/space-invaders-kaboom.js "Ania Kubów Original Source")** source, but this one show you messages if you won and allow you to keep playing if you lose

## Updates
- Game is fullscreen mode
- addLevel section allow to add the number of space invaders, in this case 3 rows with 17 aliens each one that at the end means 51 aliens that will attack you. (defined on line 20)

## Game behaviours: 
- Lose option was defined by the timer at line 119
- Winner option was defined by the aliens died that in this caae must be 51 that it was defined at line 173 and go into scene continue_playing at line 290

## Scenes 
- when game is over message is defined at line 243, this should be updated with a delay timer option instead of the keypress event that I added for now
- Score that the player made in the lose option is defined at line 262
- continue_playing is common for both scenarios and is defined at line 292, is based on a basic keypress event

## What you can do next?
- Add new level
- Update keypress event for a timer lapse option
